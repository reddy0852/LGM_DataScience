## IRIS Flowers Classification ML Project

1. Widely recognized as the "Hello World" of ML, the iris flowers dataset is ideal for beginners to grasp supervised ML fundamentals, focusing on data loading and manipulation.
2. Featuring numeric attributes, this dataset offers an entry point for newcomers to explore supervised algorithms without complex preprocessing, thanks to its manageable size.
3. With its modest scale, the iris dataset is well-suited for in-memory operations, making it an excellent choice to delve into supervised ML without intricate transformations or scaling.

## Image to Grayscale using Python

1. Convert the RGB image to grayscale, creating a black and white version.
2. Generate a negative image (inverted grayscale) to enhance details.
3. Create a pencil sketch by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image using the `cv2` library's divide function in Python.
